                    The BlackMUD community includes a diverse group of players, including minors, and your behavior (even roleplaying) should be handled accordingly. 
                    Sexually oriented behavior is not considered appropriate on BlackMUD. Any activity, RP or otherwise, that exceeds a simple show of affection or the 
                    basics of the social commands is not appropriate.

                    Multi-playing is not allowed. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:<br>
                    - Having more than one character IN the MUD at one time, whether or not it is connected.<br>
                    - Creating a situation for the purpose of benefiting another character, that you later connect to.<br>
                    - Passing funds, equipment, or information from one character to another.

                    Although, PKing is not illegal on BlackMUD, this is not a PK MUD.Meaning you should limit your PK involvement to RP related conflicts.
                    You must also first 'opt in' to PK, meaning that until you do so, you will not be able to commit harmful actions (theft included) towards
                    other players. Opted in players cannot commit harmful actions towards opted out players, and vice versa. Simply because players cannot
                    attack you while you are opted out does not give you the right to be a pest, or cause problems, so do not abuse this status.<br>
                    WARNING - ONCE OPTED IN YOU CANNOT OPT OUT!

                   <p>
                    The multi-killing rule is related to the PK rules. The multiple killing, which means more than once within a 24 hour real-time period, of 
                    characters is forbidden. Self-defense, which doesn't include pre-emptive attacks, is an exception to this rule. Any form of harmful action 
                    (including theft) can be considered an attack against you. All other cases of PK and situations of player-stealing are left to the mortal 
                    justice system.

                    kill it for the experience. Generally supporting a low level character with occassional spell-ups, dropping equipment in 
                    communal rooms, and showing someone the ropes is acceptable.
