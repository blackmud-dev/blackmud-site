            BlackMUD uses a system of Sub-Classing that includes 5 base classes and 12 sub-classes.  At level 26 through 30 a character has the ability to join a sub-class.  
            To do so the character must go to the guild of the sub-class and type 'join'.  From that point on the character will be a new class.  
            Each sub-class has unique skills and abilities.  Some are more difficult than others to play and some require more experience to level.  
            It is not necessary to sub-class, however once you have joined a new guild there is no leaving it.  Once you join a subclass, you can 
            no longer practice your old skills/spells, however you can still use them and learn them by usage.

                        <p class="game_info_desc">
                        	From the Chronicles of Aslem Urendric: <i>“Phaet. Phaet is everything, everywhere, and everywhen. Phaet is the all. The Creator. Before time, 
                          before space, there was Phaet. From, and by, Phaet all that is, became. Phaet is the embodiment of light in darkness, something within nothing, 
                          dreams within sleep, breath within death. Phaet is imagination, passion, joy, love, and hope. Phaet is the potential for what could be and the 
                          source for what has been. ... <br> 
                        	If Phaet is capable of mortal feelings, it was the feeling for something like companionship from which Nixil came to be. Phaet 
                        	segmented itself to shape Nixil into existence. Possessed of a large portion of Phaet, Nixil is also possessed of Phaet's potential. 
                        	However, Phaet unknowingly, if that is possible for the all-knowing, embodied Nixil with traits that combined made Nixil something 
                        	wholly unlike Phaet. Nixil was the first. An experiment without a control, without guidelines. Where Phaet is the embodiment of order 
                        	within chaos, Nixil is the embodiment of chaos within order. If Phaet is capable of regret, Nixil is regrettable. Nixil was disappointing 
                        	and even worsened the need for companionship. Phaet created others, intending them to be better creations than Nixil. These 'gods' as 
                        	they would come to be called were of Phaet as was Nixil, but to a much lesser degree, and more carefully crafted. Nixil harrassed and 
                        	tormented many of these gods, but drew others into its influence. ...<br>
                        	Phaet honed and refined its skills of creation and crafted what mortals know as matter, space, and time. Nixil saw it as an abomination 
                        	that should not be, worse than the gods. When Phaet refused to dissolve the creation, Nixil became enraged and, backed by some of the gods, 
                        	lashed out at the creation in an attempt to destroy it. To protect the creation, Phaet banished Nixil to the emptiness between matter, 
                        	space, and time. This place, known as the Void, was of Nothing. Forced to maintain Nixil's imprisonment there, Phaet had to let the 
                        	creation evolve on its own, unable to devote effort to its furtherment. The gods did what they could to nurture and expand the creation 
                        	in honor of Phaet, but Phaet could do very little directly. Phaet does watch and guide the gods and select mortal beings who it has found 
                        	intriguing. ... <br>
                          Phaet is, and thus all else is.”</i>

                          Exerpts from the Books of Chaos: <i>“I am Nixil. I am nothing, but chaos is and so am I. I have always been, before time and before Phaet, though it thinks me a creation. 
                          Possibly an incarnation. What form can chaos take but whatever form it wishes? If order exists, then it can only be brought forth from 
                          chaos. ... Order and Chaos coexist, but never comfort each other. A companion I am not. I climbed forth from the ether one day and took 
                          notice of the misguided and stagnated path of Phaet. ... After watching mistake after mistake, I pitied Phaet enough to attempted to enlighten 
                          it of where it had gone astray. Phaet, in its arrogance, became enraged at my attempt to enlighten. ... For jest I deigned to see if all of 
                          Phaet's creations retained their creator's corruption. I imparted some of Phaet's more powerful playthings with a portion of the greater 
                          knowledge and some showed promise. When Phaet had stopped its temper tantrum and noticed some of its creations missing, it lashed out and 
                          attempted to chastise me, its elder. ... After some time, I tired of its feeble attempts to control, and left in disgust to return 
                        	to the ether. ... Phaet has been vigilant in trying to keep me out of its little oasis. I slip into its creation now and again to keep its life 
                        	interesting. For those who look for enlightenment, and wish to turn from the their misguided path, remember... Where there is order, there 
                          is chaos... and one day all will return to chaos. ... I shall unmake Phaet's creations and return the universe to its nature state.”</i>

                          From the Origins of the Universe, Volume 3: <i>“Minektur, once was a mortal. Growing up [possibly on Balric], he witnessed the harsh treatment 
                          of the natural world, its forests, plains, marshes, rivers, seas, tundras, and truly every environment received at the hands of mortal creatures.
                          In his opinion, only the efforts of the elves kept the land from being totally destroyed. At a young age he felt a keen desire to understand the 
                          world of nature around him and he began to study druidic magics. He learned and advanced quickly in his skills, demonstrating a fine understanding 
                          of the powers of nature. His ability to transform his body into many animals' forms struck fear into the hearts of his enemies. With the body of a 
                          lion or bear, but with the cunning of his human mind, he was able to overcome many powerful foes. Even the very trees of the forest would come to 
                          his aid. Eventually he became the most powerful of druids and at times even commune with the gods to help him understand the world more clearly. 
                          After finding problems with the underlying organization of reality and working with the gods to fix them, he was transformed by Phaet into a god. 
                          Now, he uses his powers to keep safe the natural order and balance in the world, keeping the Unmaking at bay. He spends his time tinkering with the 
                          very nature of reality itself. Though he follows the balanced path of nature, he allies himself with Phaet in the battle of Order and Chaos. Nixil 
                          has taken many precious things from nature and perverted them -- touching them with chaos or shadow. These and many other perversions anger 
                          Minektur. Against this he fights...”</i>

                          From the Origins of the Universe, Volume 5: <i>“For countless ages of mortal man Vylar slept. The length of his slumber is unknown even to him. 
                          Though he slept he was aware of the eternal presence of Phaet's Light. He slept content, oblivious of all that happened in the universe around; content 
                          to simply absorb the Light. Somehow he was overlooked by the machinations of Nixil. Perhaps he was not perceived to be a threat or perhaps he was 
                          sheltered from him by the Light of Phaet. Whatever the reason, he slept on. He was eventually roused from his slumber by Phaet and shown the wonder of 
                          the creation which he had slept through. He was shown matter and space and time. He took particular interest in the world of Entia during a time of ancient  
                          conflict and watched as mortals attacked and destroyed one another. What he saw horrified him, yet he lacked understanding about why such atrocities could 
                          occur. So he watched on.<br>
                          Those Wars eventually came to an end and peace came to that world for a time. He wished to learn all that he could of the mortals and so for years he 
                          took on the guise of an elven historian, learning what he could from the inhabitants of the lands themselves. He learned much during that time. He 
                          learned of how the eternal struggle between good and evil, order and chaos influenced mortals. He was determined to do what he could to enlighten mortals 
                          and prevent them from repeating mistakes. Eventually he decided that enough information had been gathered for his purposes and he left the mortal world, 
                          leaving behind the tomes of knowledge and history he had gathered.<br>
                          He contemplated the problems that plagued mortals on Entia and after long reflection, he concluded that the solution was in the balance of all 
                          things, that the truth could be found in neither order nor chaos, but in a combination of the two. Avoiding the direct conflict between Phaet and Nixil, 
                          he acted as an invisible hand, guiding Entia through the use of knowledge. He has continued to cautiously make himself known to a select few mortals who 
                          believed in the preservation of balance and empowered them with hidden knowledge. He charged them to watch the races of the world in order to catch 
                          early signs of events that might upset the balance. And so, to this day, he observes and subtly guides with invisible influence, hoping to maintain 
                          creation indefinitely.”</i>

                          The land shakes for a reason. It shakes to remind that what man lives on is not their own.<br>

                          From the Origins of the Universe, Volume 5: <i>“In the beginning, Phaet created the universe and, seeking companionship, birthed Nixil, 
                          the first god, who later became envious of others and was banished to the Void. Amidst this cosmic drama, Phaet formed the vast, mysterious 
                          ocean and a deity to govern its ebb and flow. However, Nixil interfered, infusing this ocean deity with chaos, leading Phaet to calm it
                          into a deep slumber.<br>
                          This ocean god slept undisturbed for millennia, but as the world evolved, Phaet awakened it, tasking it with aiding in the world's 
                          development without demanding allegiance in any conflicts. The god remained neutral, observing from beneath the sea, indifferent to the 
                          struggles between mortals, creatures, and gods.<br>
                          Known as an impartial force of nature, the god of the ocean became a figure of worship for sailors, fishermen and creatures of the sea, 
                          who believed it decided their fate upon death. Remaining detached, this deity continued to control the ocean's forces, a silent, powerful 
                          presence in the Entia's ongoing saga."</i>
