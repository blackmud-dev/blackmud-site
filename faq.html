                     <p>
                     	MUD is an acronym meaning Multi-User Domain or Multi-User Dungeon. MUDs are a test-based online virtual realm and the precursors to modern MMORPGs.
                     	You can create a character, enter the realm, and interact with people from all over the world as well as the realm itself. There are generally no 
                     	graphics, except ASCII based art and maps, and what you may encounter a MUD Client interface.<br>
                     	Although this may sound primitive to someone weened on high definition graphics, I would caution you to not underestimate the experience. The MUD's 
                     	descriptions and ambiance can form pictures in your mind's eye, which fancy graphics cards can't even begin to touch. Pure imagination is a powerful media.
                     </p>
                 </div>

                 <div class="faq_info_desc">
                     <p>
                     	Role-playing, or RP as it is usually referred to, means just that... playing a role. You control the thoughts and actions of your character as if it were actually part 
                     	of the realm.
                     </p>
                 </div>

                     <p>
                     	After creating your character (see below), you will see a list of options before actually entering the realm. New players who are unfamiliar with 
                     	MUDs should take the time to go through the Mud Tutorial. As with most fantasy RPGs (role playing games), your character starts out rather weak 
                     	and must advance in levels to get "tougher". BlackMUD uses a exp/level based advancement system very similar to most other RPGs.<br>
                     	In simple terms:<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You kill stuff.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get items and gold.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gain experience points.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you gain enough experience points, you can advance to your next level.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaining levels means more HP's, Mana, spells, skills, etc.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix it all up with some nice RP to flesh it out.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a blast doing it!<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat.

                     <p>
                     	BlackMUD is not a game you win or for that matter ends. It is a virtual alter-reality where everyday life is an adventure. Think of it a bit like 
                     	a text-based cross between SIMs, Diablo, and Zork.

                     <p>
                     	I strongly suggest an in-depth read of the History either on the BlackMUD webpage (Click Here)or in-game via the history command. 
                     	The realm of Entia is lavishly detailed, rich in content, and totally original.

                     	Admin. You can send email to mudadmin@blackmud.com or you can use the pray command in the game to present your questions to an

                     <p>
                     	You can start the character generation process via the Enter the Realm link on the left side of the BlackMUD webpage. Or you can 
                     	just telnet to: <a href="telnet://blackmud.com 2000">blackmud.com 2000</a>

                     <p>
                     	It usually helps to have some idea of what kind of character you will be making before you get to this point. Names can often be 
                     	elusive. If you're having difficulty choosing a name, I would suggest giving the Random Name Generator on the BlackMUD web page a 
                     	try. You might just run across something you like or it might give you a good idea for one of your own.<br>
                      Note: Please be aware that BlackMUD has a Name Policy which is strictly adhered to. The by-laws are presented during the character 
                      creation steps or you can type help name while in the game.

                     <p>
                     	Entropy in BlackMUD refers to your character's innate tendency towards Order, Neutrality, or Chaos. If your character is 
                     	ordered, he/she has a tendency to obey laws and social morals, enforce those laws/morals, and in general presents a sense 
                     	of structure and order in his/her actions. If your character is chaotic, then he/she tends to be impulsive, casually 
                     	disregards authority, and generally presenting a sense of being unruly and unstructured. If your character has a neutral 
                     	entrophatic nature, then he/she feels the need to balance his actions as well as the environment around him/her. This may 
                     	be confusing at first to new players. In the realm of Entia, there is a struggle between order and chaos. This attribute 
                     	defines where your character is at on the entrophatic spectrum. (Note: Here, it has nothing to do with thermodynamics.)

                     	As in most mythological/fantasy settings, the cosmos is ruled by powerful beings that are worshipped as gods. These beings 
                     	are both Immortal characters and game administrators. The available choices are governed by both your alignment and your 
                     	entrophatic nature. You can read about each of the gods in the Pantheon section of the BlackMUD web page. For new players, 
                     	I would suggest the option at first. You can always change it later for more in-depth RP.

                      Hit Points: These represent your character's life points. When you take damage, it is subtracted from your current HPs 
                      total. When your HPs reach 0, you fall stunned. At -10 you die. (help death)<br>    
                      Mana Points: These represent a spell-caster's ability to manipulate magic in the form of spells. Each spell has a mana 
                      cost (modified by your skill and level) and when it is cast, its cost is subtracted from your current MP total.
                      When your MPs fall too low, you will be unable to meet the cost requirements of your spells and thus won’t be able to cast it. (help cast)<br> 
                      Movement Points: When your character moves from one room/area to another, it uses a small number of movement points 
                      (depending on terrain). When your Movement Points fall too low, you will find yourself exhausted and in need of some rest.
