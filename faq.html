                     	 BlackMUD is one of the oldest still-running MUDs online today, having started in 1993. It is text-only multi-player adventure, set in a fantasy 
                     	 role-playing environment.

                     <p>
                     	MUD is an acronym meaning Multi-User Domain or Multi-User Dungeon. MUDs are a text-based online virtual realm and the precursors to modern MMORPGs.
                     	You can create a character, enter the realm, and interact with people from all over the world. There are generally no graphics, except ASCII based 
                     	art and maps, and what you may encounter through a MUD Client interface.<br>
                     	Although this may sound primitive to someone weened on high definition graphics, do not underestimate the experience. The MUD's descriptions and 
                     	ambiance can form pictures in your mind's eye, which fancy graphics cards can't even begin to touch. Pure imagination is a powerful media.

                     <p>
                     	Role-playing, or RP as it is usually referred to, means just that... playing a role. You control the thoughts and actions of your character as if it 
                     	were actually part of the realm. RP is not enforced on BlackMUD (it is not RPI), so don't worry that you are not a good enough role-players, but we do 
                     	provide numerous mechanisms to support and reward role-playing.
                     </p>
                 </div>
             </div>

                 <div class="faq_info_label"><p>How do I access the game?</p></div>
                 <div class="faq_info_desc">
                     <p>
                     	Given the older nature of MUDs in general, accessing a MUD most commonly involves utilizing a Telnet connection. Telnet is a common network protocol that 
                     	allows a user on one computer to log into another computer. In the early days of the Internet this was one of the most common ways to connect to computers. 
                     	To connect to BlackMUD you will need either a Telnet client or more commonly a MUD client. For more enjoyable playability, we recommend a MUD client. You 
                     	can find one <a href="https://www.mudlet.org/">here</a>. Once you have a MUD or Telnet client you simply connect to blackmud.com using port 2000 
                     	[<a href="telnet://blackmud.com:2000">blackmud.com:2000</a>]. Then let the adventure begin.
                     </p>
                 </div>
             </div>
          </div> 
 
          <div class="faq_block">
             <div class="faq_card_block">
                 <div class="faq_info_label"><p>How do I play?</p></div>
                 <div class="faq_info_desc">
                     <p>
                     	After connecting to the game (see above) you will need to first create an account and then verify that account through an email adress and confirmation 
                     	code process. After creating your account you can create a character. Creating a character can stake some time, but it also you to highly customize your 
                     	game experience.<br>
                     	Once you create a character, you will see a menu of options including one to enter the realm. New players who are unfamiliar with MUDs should take the 
                     	time to go through the Mud Tutorial. As with most fantasy RPGs (role playing games), your character starts out rather weak and must advance in levels to 
                     	get "tougher". BlackMUD uses a exp/level based advancement system very similar to most other RPGs.<br>
                     	In simple terms:<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You kill stuff.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get items and gold.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You gain experience points.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you gain enough experience points, you can advance to your next level.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaining levels means more HP's, Mana, spells, skills, etc.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix it all up with some nice RP to flesh it out.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have a blast doing it!<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat.

                     <p>
                     	BlackMUD is not a game you win or for that matter even really ends. It is a virtual alternative-reality where everyday life is an adventure. Think of it 
                     	a bit like a text-based cross between The Sims, Diablo 3, and a Choose Your Own Adventure book.

                     <p>
                     	I strongly suggest an in-depth read of the information provided on this website, including the History, Pantheon, Classes, and Races..You can also find more 
                     	information in the extensive help system in the game and through discovered content while playing the game itself. BlackMUD and the world of Entia is lavishly 
                     	detailed, rich in content, and original in composition.

                     <p>
                     	Typing 'help' in the game will give you the main list of game commands. You can access more in-depth information about each individual command and examples of its 
                     	usage by using the help system. If you run across any that are hard to find or not there, please notify BlackMUD Admin (link at the bottom of this page).

                     <p>
                     	It usually helps to have some idea of what kind of character you will be making before you get to this point. Names can often be 
                     	elusive. If you're having difficulty choosing a name, we suggest giving an internet Random Name Generator a try. You might just run 
                     	across something you like or it might give you a good idea for one of your own.<br>
                      Note: Please be aware that BlackMUD has a Name Policy which is strictly adhered to. The by-laws are presented during the character 
                      creation steps or you can type help name while in the game.

                     <p>
                     	Entropy in BlackMUD refers to your character's innate tendency towards Order, Neutrality, or Chaos. If your character is 
                     	ordered, he/she has a tendency to obey laws and social morals, enforce those laws/morals, and in general presents a sense 
                     	of structure and order in his/her actions. If your character is chaotic, then he/she tends to be impulsive, casually 
                     	disregards authority, and generally presenting a sense of being unruly and unstructured. If your character has a neutral 
                     	entrophatic nature, then he/she feels the need to balance his actions as well as the environment around him/her. This may 
                     	be confusing at first to new players. In the realm of Entia, there is a struggle between order and chaos. This attribute 
                     	defines where your character is at on the entrophatic spectrum. (Note: It has little to do with thermodynamics.)

                     	are both Immortal characters and game administrators. The available choices are governed by both your alignment and your 
                     	entrophatic nature. You can read about each of the gods in the Pantheon section of the BlackMUD web page. For new players, 
                     	I would suggest the option at first. You can always change it later for more in-depth RP.

                      Hit Points: These represent your character's life points. When you take damage, it is subtracted from your current HPs 
                      total. When your HPs reach 0, you fall stunned. At -10 you die. (help death)<br>    
                      Mana Points: These represent a spell-caster's ability to manipulate magic in the form of spells. Each spell has a mana 
                      cost (modified by your skill and level) and when it is cast, its cost is subtracted from your current MP total.
                      When your MPs fall too low, you will be unable to meet the cost requirements of your spells and thus won’t be able to cast it. (help cast)<br> 
                      Movement Points: When your character moves from one room/area to another, it uses a small number of movement points 
                      (depending on terrain). When your Movement Points fall too low, you will find yourself exhausted and in need of some rest.
