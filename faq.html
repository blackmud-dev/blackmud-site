                What is a MUD?

                        MUD is an acronym meaning Multi-User Domain (some refer to it as Multi-User Dungeon, mostly because they can't get their heads out of the middle ages.) Basically, it's an online virtual realm. You can create a character, enter the realm, and interact with people from all over the world as well as the realm itself. There are NO graphics. It is a purely TEXT-based environment.<br><br>Although this may sound primitive to someone weened on most any other game out there, I would caution you to not underestimate the experience. The MUD's descriptions and ambiance can form pictures in your mind's eye, which fancy graphics cards can't even begin to touch. Pure imagination is a powerful media

                    <li>
                        RP, as it is usually referred to, means just that... playing a role. You control the thoughts and actions of your character as if it were actually part of the realm. This is a rather in-depth topic which is clearly discussed in the Roleplaying section on the BlackMUD website <a href="rules.html">Rules Page</a>.

                    <li>
                        BlackMUD is not a game you win or for that matter ends. It is a virtual alter-reality where everyday life is an adventure. Think of it a bit like a text-based cross between SIMs, Diablo, and Zork.

                </ul>

    After creating your character (see below), you will see a list of options before actually entering the realm. New players who are unfamiliar with MUDs should take the time to go through the Mud Tutorial. As with most fantasy RPGs (role playing games), your character starts out rather weak and must advance in levels to get "tougher". BlackMUD uses a exp/level based advancement system very similar to most other RPGs. In simple terms:<br><br>


    You kill stuff.<br>
    You get items and gold.<br>
    You gain experience points.<br>
    After you gain enough experience points, you can advance to your next level.<br>
    Gaining levels means more HP's, Mana, spells, skills, etc.<br>
    Mix it all up with some nice RP to flesh it out.<br>
    Have a blast doing it!<br>
    Wash. Rinse. Repeat.

                        I strongly suggest an in-depth read of the History either on the BlackMUD webpage (Click Here)or in-game via the history command. The realm of Entia is lavishly detailed, rich in content, and totally original.

    Typing help will give you the main list of game commands. By typing help, you'll be given more in-depth information about each individual command and examples of its usage. If you run across any that are hard to find or not there, please notify BlackMUD Admin. You can send email to mudadmin@blackmud.com or you can use the pray command in the game to present your questions to an available immortal.<br><br>

    Note: Please refrain from SPAMMING the pray channel. This tends to anger the immortals and will invoke their wrath upon your poor helpless mortal character.

                        You can start the character generation process via the Enter the Realm link on the left side of the BlackMUD webpage. Or you can just telnet to: blackmud.com 2000

    It usually helps to have some idea of what kind of character you will be making before you get to this point. Names can often be elusive. If you're having difficulty choosing a name, I would suggest giving the Random Name Generator on the BlackMUD web page a try. You might just run across something you like or it might give you a good idea for one of your own.<br><br>

    Note: Please be aware that BlackMUD has a Name Policy which is strictly adhered to. The by-laws are presented during the character creation steps or you can type help name while in the game.

                        Entropy in BlackMUD refers to your character's innate tendency towards Order, Neutrality, or Chaos. If your character is ordered, he/she has a tendency to obey laws and social morals, enforce those laws/morals, and in general presents a sense of structure and order in his/her actions. If your character is chaotic, then he/she tends to be impulsive, casually disregards authority, and generally presenting a sense of being unruly and unstructured. If your character has a neutral entrophatic nature, then he/she feels the need to balance his actions as well as the environment around him/her. This may be confusing at first to new players. In the realm of Entia, there is a struggle between order and chaos. This attribute defines where your character is at on the entrophatic spectrum. (Note: Here, it has nothing to do with thermodynamics.)

                    <li>
                        As in most mythological/fantasy settings, the cosmos is ruled by powerful beings that are worshipped as gods. These beings are both Immortal characters and game administrators. The available choices are governed by both your alignment and your entrophatic nature. You can read about each of the gods in the Pantheon section of the BlackMUD web page. For new players, I would suggest the option at first. You can always change it later for more in-depth RP.

                        Most veteran players will suggest Makilor. It tends to be the social hub for most of BlackMUD's players, as well as being rather centrally located on the world map. This doesn't mean that the others are inadequate.<br><br>Ba-ul Naran is a vast metropolis and is the cultural and trade center of the realm.<br><br>Vomel (Novdom) is a nice quiet place to learn the game in relative solitude.<br><br>Tansar is an excellent place to begin an adventuring career, and is located near the underground dwarven city of Mreec.

    The numbers shown in your prompt ( <32 68 119> ) represent Hit Points (HP), Mana Points (MP), and Movement Points. (help prompt, help hp, help mana, help move)<br><br>

        Hit Points: These represent your character's life points. When you take damage, it is subtracted from your current HPs total. When your HPs reach 0, you fall stunned. At -10 you die. (help death)<br><br>
    
        Mana Points: These represent a spell-caster's ability to manipulate magic in the form of spells. Each spell has a mana cost (modified by your skill and level) and when it is cast, its cost is subtracted from your current MP total. When your MPs fall too low, you will be unable to meet the cost requirements of your spells and thus won’t be able to cast it. (help cast)<br><br>
    
        Movement Points: When your character moves from one room/area to another, it uses a small number of movement points (depending on terrain). When your Movement Points fall too low, you will find yourself exhausted and in need of some rest.

    Your character has 6 main attribute scores. These are commonly referred to as "stats". These will usually be represented in a number range from 3-18. (3=pathetic, 4-8 below average, 9-12 normal human average, 13-17 above average, 18=maximum human potential)<br><br>

    Strength - Physical power. Affects damage and carried weight capacity.<br>
    Dexterity - Physical agility and balance. Affects defense and thief-type skills.<br>
    Constitution - Physical health and fortitude. Affects HP gains and some resistances.<br>
    Intelligence - Mental prowess and aptitude. Affects Mana gains and learning.<br>
    Wisdom - Mental/Spiritual strength and fortitude. Affects certain resistances.<br>
    Charisma - Leadership potential and ability to influence others. Affects # of followers and shops.<br><br>

    Note: You will not be able to "see" these numbers at first. At 16th level, they will present themselves when you type att (attribute).
