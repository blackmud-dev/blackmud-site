            BlackMUD uses a system of Sub-Classing that includes 5 base classes and 12 sub-classes.  At level 26 through 30 a character has the ability to join a sub-class.  
            To do so the character must go to the guild of the sub-class and type 'join'.  From that point on the character will be a new class.  
            Each sub-class has unique skills and abilities.  Some are more difficult than others to play and some require more experience to level.  
            It is not necessary to sub-class, however once you have joined a new guild there is no leaving it.  Once you join a subclass, you can 
            no longer practice your old skills/spells, however you can still use them and learn them by usage.

                                Anti-Paladins are the polar opposites of their better known adversaries, Paladins.  Though considered servants of evil, Anti-Paladins 
                                serve no one but themselves.  They thrive on the pain and suffering that greed driven people pay them to inflict on others.  In essence they are
                                little more than highly skilled mercenaries.  Anti-Paladins often serve as military commanders for corrupt nobles and merchants.  It is said that
                                kings would sooner invite an assassin to dinner than have an Anti-Paladin in their service.  Of course this doesn't mean that no king employs them.
                                In addition to their warrior skills, Anti-Paladins are able to cast some clerical spells and employ some thief skills.
                                In order to join the Anti-Paladin guild, one needs to be a devout follower of the Unmaking and thus Nixil, and have the utmost disregard for 
                                righteousness and law.

                                bigger, stronger, and more durable in battle.  Preferring light tough armor, they are usually surprisingly quick.  Barbarians tend to avoid large cities,
                                preferring the open vistas.  Barbarians have been known to go into strange fits during battle that makes them amazingly destructive to their opponents
                                and sometimes their allies.  Barbarians have a range of skills to help them in battle and to navigate the wilderness.

                                several are known to serve as officers in the army of Makilor.  However most Paladins do serve the high clerics of Phaet.  Paladins place justice and 
                                righteousness above all.  Many people often turn to Paladins for judgment in disputes.  

                                Paladins are able to cast many clerical spells in addition to their martial skills.

                                Rangers are often hired by travelers as guides or escorts.  Rangers generally begin traveling as warriors and later decide to abandon the
                                oppression of society. Rangers are able to cast a few druidic spells and have a variety of combative and survival skills.

                                While the average warrior is proficient in all forms of armed combat, the swordsman has eschewed other weapons in order to achieve complete mastery over
                                the blade.  Without a sword in hand, the swordsman is at best a second-class warrior, but when wielding a blade, the swordsman becomes one of the most
                                dangerous individuals in the realms.  Generally, swordsmen concentrate on keeping their opponents from connecting in combat as much as they do on
                                connecting themselves and are known to be capable of entering a trace-like calm before battle, during which they are capable of inflicting far
                                more damage than would normally be possible.  Mastery over the blade also allows the swordsman to guess at a weapon's quality with a
                                greater degree of accuracy than other warriors.  While most warriors rely upon sheer brawn to carry them through battle, the 
                                swordsman uses agility and quick wits to elevate his combat from simple "hack and slash" to an elegant art form.

                                They are the guardians of nature and they remain neutral with regard to other concerns.  They develop resistance and sometimes immunity to charm,
                                poison, electricity, cold and fire. If a druid strays from the path (i.e.: is no longer neutral) they will slowly lose their ability to cast spells.  
                                The farther they stray from neutrality, the harder it is for them to cast spells.

                                A Warlock is usually a mage who has decided to no longer depend on warriors as escorts.  Warlocks have put a stop to their magical studies in
                                order to take up the study of the martial arts.  Warlocks are amazingly deadly opponents, combining offensive magics with skilled martial combat.
                                Warlocks spend a great deal of time learning how to concentrate on spell casting, while engaging in combat.  A large number of warlocks serve as an 
                                elite unit in the army of Ba-ul Naran.  The majority of warlocks prefer to explore the world and search for magical items.
                                Warlocks have both combat skills and their previously learned magical spells.

                          Monks are masters of harmony. They are very aware of their internal balance and are resistant to things that upset that balance. This characteristic 
                          does not necessarily force them to be neutral. Over time their training enables them to attack others with their bare hands and to kick things with 
                          amazing force. Their focus on their being neutralizes any affect dexterity would normally have on their armor class. Very little is reflex anymore. 
                          As they become more powerful they become resistant and eventually immune to things that would disturb their internal balance. 
                          <!-- These include poison, haste, charm, slow, and paralyze. By 11th level a monk is already immune to haste, slow and paralyze. At 15th level they 
                          develop a resistance to poison which turns into an immunity at 32nd. At18th level they are resistant to charm. At 36th level they are immune to it. 
                          Monks are designed to be weak and equipment starved at low levels. At high levels they rival warriors. They are doomed to poverty at lower levels 
                          and restricted from saving money, but may prosper after proving their worth at higher levels. -->

                                Monks are known for their serenity.  Devil-Monks, however, are known for their intensity.  They are a militant branch of the monk society.  While
                                other monks believe in contemplation, Devil-Monks live for action.  Devil-Monks normally live many years in seclusion like normal monks before
                                setting off into the world in an attempt to bring their contemplation to fruition.  Devil-Monks are furiously effective hand-to-hand combatants.
                                They usually maintain the monk philosophy of limited wealth and possessions, and tend to be balanced in their relation to good and evil.  They are often
                                considered to be outside the normal flow of nature and are often shunned by clerics.
                                Devil-Monks have a wide variety of hand-to-hand combat skills.

                          as picking locks. They are not very combat oriented, however, so do not expect to be able to kill many things by yourself. The useful aspect of 
                          thieves involves their ability to scout ahead, avoiding monsters, detecting and removing traps and selling and buying items at the black market.

                                Brigands have many of the skills of any other thief but also have some combative abilities.
