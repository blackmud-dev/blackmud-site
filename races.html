            BlackMUD uses a system of Sub-Classing that includes 5 base classes and 12 sub-classes.  At level 26 through 30 a character has the ability to join a sub-class.  
            To do so the character must go to the guild of the sub-class and type 'join'.  From that point on the character will be a new class.  
            Each sub-class has unique skills and abilities.  Some are more difficult than others to play and some require more experience to level.  
            It is not necessary to sub-class, however once you have joined a new guild there is no leaving it.  Once you join a subclass, you can 
            no longer practice your old skills/spells, however you can still use them and learn them by usage.

                            Humans are the most prevalent race on Entia. They originated on the continent of Suma but most were forced to flee to Balric 
                            several hundred years ago, due to massive war, famine and plague. Humans vary roughly between 5 and 7 feet in height. They are 
                            of varying skin, hair and eye color. On Suma they often lived in communities of similar coloring, but on Balric they are mixed. 
                            They are of widely varying strength and intelligence. Humans have the capability to adapt themselves to just about any 
                            occupation or environment, and often excel at their chosen professions. Individually, humans can be of any alignment or 
                            entrophatic nature. The last millennium of history on Balric is tied to the relationship between humans and elves. Humans went 
                            from refugees to slaves to revolutionaries to rulers. Humans, whom seldom live beyond seventy years, however, can produce as many 
                            as two dozen offspring in a lifetime. Because of this, the numbers of humans grew rapidly. Humans now rule much of Balric in the 
                            form of several large nations. Human society has a strong tendency towards chaos, and the world of humans is always in a state 
                            of flux.

                            Dwarves are a short, stout people. Dwarves, both male and female, average between four and five feet in height. They have thick, 
                            course hair; most often of brown or red coloring. Dwarven culture prizes long, thick beards, which are often braided and decorated 
                            with beads and gems. Despite the plethora of racial jokes, dwarven women do not have facial hair, though many do wear heavy 
                            be-gemmed veils over the lower half of their faces. Dwarves are an extremely hearty race, with enormous strength in relation to 
                            their size and highly acute night vision. They have a natural resistance to infection and disease, and are resistant to many 
                            poisons. Strangely there is a disproportionately high infant mortality rate among dwarves. Dwarven stature undoubtedly evolved from 
                            the millennia the race has spent in the mountains and caverns of the Tek Ar Mountains. They spend much of their time mining precious 
                            metals and stones and tending underground plant farms and water wells. Their vast stores of metal ore and gems supply a lucrative
                            trade with the other races. Other than a relative handful of dwarves living in the various human cities and a couple small colonies, 
                            most dwarves live in the vast underground city of Mreec. Dwarves despise gralner and the 'strunkt' (sub-human) races, and have been 
                            known to attack them on sight. Since the Second War of Dominance, dwarves have trained extensively in defensive combat techniques 
                            against giant-sized opponents. Dwarves have little natural aptitude for manipulating chaos and they dislike magic in general, 
                            however, they do make exceptional clerics.

                            Elves are the oldest of the sentient races on Entia. It is believed they were the first to branch off from the common evolutionary path 
                            that the majority of the races come from. They are similar in height to humans, roughly 5 to 7 feet. Also like humans they have varying 
                            skin, hair and eye color. Their facial features are slightly narrower than the average human, their ears tend to be longer and thinner, 
                            and their eyes are slightly larger in proportion to their faces. Elves grow very little in the way of facial hair. Elves are usually 
                            slight or athletic in build, with a fat elf being a truly rare sight. They are extremely quick and agile, and have extremely acute 
                            vision. They have a strong natural ability to manipulate chaos and are very intelligent in general. Elves were the dominant species on 
                            Entia, the continent of Balric specifically, for millennia. Elves can live to be four hundred years old, but can only produce a handful 
                            of offspring during that time. This longevity, combined with a social inflexibility, turned out to be their undoing. The relationship 
                            between humans and elves has shaped much of the recent history of Balric. Elves, once masters of enormous and wondrous cities, were 
                            reduced to being the slaves of those they persecuted. They eventually threw off their own shackles and became nomadic warriors, 
                            struggling for survival and redemption. During the last one hundred years, elves have become adept at surviving in the wilds of Balric 
                            and conducting devastating hit and run attacks on the smaller settlements of humans. In the most recent years, a shaky peace has been 
                            established between humans and elves, due to the efforts of a handful of enlightened and generous individuals. There remains a great 
                            deal of animosity between elves and humans, and between elves and dwarves to a lesser extent. Elves, like many races, have no tolerance 
                            for the 'sub-human' races, like orcs and ogres. Elves are equally at home in large cities and in the most rugged of wilderness.

                            Halflings are the smallest of the humanoid races, averaging three to four feet in height. They are slight of build and can be easily 
                            mistaken for human children. Halflings don't have facial hair and usually wear their hair long. Their skin is golden brown in color and 
                            often have colorful tattoos on their arms and torso. Halflings are extremely nimble and quick. They also have a robust immune system that 
                            makes them immune to most poisons and allows them to heal quickly. Halflings have a natural aptitude for magic and their size and dexterity 
                            make them exceptional thieves. Halflings never have more than two offspring in a lifetime, thus they are very few in number. Other than a 
                            small number that live in the cities of other races, most halflings live in the forest area known as N'wic.

                        Half-elves are the result of a union between an elf and a human. Half-elves can easily pass for human or elf, depending mainly on their 
                        choice of hair style and whether they have facial hair or not. They retain the sturdiness of their human side and the nimbleness of their 
                        elven side. Like both races they have an affinity for manipulating chaos and make good clerics. Only some half-elves inherit the acute vision 
                        of the elves, however. The type of union that produces a half-elf is considered taboo by most members of both races, due to the years of war 
                        and hatred between the two species. Often a half-elf was the result of rape, however, in more recent years they have resulted more commonly 
                        out of love. Some half-elves are raised openly in elvish communities and are often resentful of the treatment they receive from their peers. 
                        Half-elves are shunned by both races and prefer the faceless masses of the human cities to dwell in.

                            Half-giants are born from the uncommon union of a giant and a human. They are the 'average' of giants and humans. They are larger than 
                            humans but smaller than giants and quicker than giants but slower than most humans. They exhibit the full range of human hair, eye and 
                            skin coloring. Their combination of size and speed make them excellent warriors and able to cover great distances in a short time.                          	
                            Half-giants lack the ability to manipulate chaos but make excellent clerics. Most half-giants live among the giants of Gartome, but a 
                            few frequent the human cities, where their size often makes them valuable soldiers and guards.

                            Half-orcs are a milder version of their orcish parent. They are usually born of human mothers and orcish fathers. Half-orc children 
                            born to orcish mothers, tend to have very short lives. Half-orcs for the most part appear as deformed humans. They often have broad, 
                            flat faces, jagged teeth, slightly grayish skin coloring and more body hair than a normal human. They are stronger than a normal human 
                            of the same size. Like their orcish parent, they lack the ability to manipulate chaos. Also, like orcs they lack the necessary aptitude 
                            to be clerics or monks.
                            Half-orcs are social outcasts. They often live in the shadier sections of the large human cities. Many survive by working as thieves 
                            or hired thugs. They are scorned by merchants and guards and stay in the shadows as much as possible. With enough clothing, some 
                            half-orcs can pass as human.

                            Mirlad are the result of inter-breeding between elves and dwarves. They tend to be of dwarven height and of elven-build and have the 
                            thick course hair of dwarves. They have both the tensile strength of dwarven musculature and the agility of the elven frame. Roughly 
                            half of mirlad inherit the acute vision of their elven parent. Mirlad tend to be less adept at magic than elves.
                            Dwarves and elves were mildly hostile towards one another for hundreds of years before the arrival of humans on Balric, and both 
                            societies frown upon inter-breeding. Thus mirlad are considered social outcasts.                            
                            Most Mirlad are sterile from birth and thus not capable of reproducing. Because of their social status, most Mirlad live near humans, 
                            to avoid the scorn of their parents' races. The melding of dwarven and elven features tone down the distinguishing characteristics. 
                            In fact, they are often mistaken for human.

                        <p class="game_info_desc">
                            Giants are the largest of the sentient races on Entia. They average between eight and nine feet in height. Though some can be 
                            extremely large in girth, they have a tendency to be slim. Even a giant of slim build is extremely strong due to their overall 
                            size. Giants tend to be a colorful people, with their hair and skin being various hues. Giants tend to only breed with giants 
                            of the same hue, thus the coloration of a given giant are distinctive of its family or tribe. The Haendaki tribe for example 
                            tends to have ruddy skin and fiery red hair and an equally fiery temperament. Humans and dwarves have taken to referring to 
                            them by representations of their coloration. The Haendaki are commonly refereed to as fire giants. As well, giants tend to garb 
                            themselves in clothing of similar coloration.
                            Giants live almost exclusively in the Gartome Mountains in the northwest corner of Balric. For the most part they are content 
                            to stay within this region and live a simple and relatively peaceful existence. For some unknown reason, during the Second War 
                            of Dominance, the great tribes flowed out of Gartome and inflicted terrible casualties on the armies of man and dwarf. That is 
                            the only time in known history that giants have left their native land en masse.
                            Giants shun the cities of other races, perhaps feeling awkward or confined by the small enclosures or unwelcome by the smaller 
                            races. Dwarves in particular don't care for giants and allow very few to enter the halls of Mreec. They excel at rock carving 
                            and metal work, like their diminutive distant cousins the dwarves. Giant metal and rockwork is very distinctive from that of 
                            the dwarves, however. For the most part, giants are a surprisingly jovial and intelligent species. They lack the innate ability 
                            to manipulate chaos and their size precludes them from more stealthy occupations. They are ferocious warriors when forced to 
                            fight and there are a number of strong giant clerics.

                            Gorbocs are slightly smaller and slimmer than standard Orcs but exhibit a higher level of intelligence. They possess the same 
                            thick, course hair on their necks and spines. Their skin is also thick and rough, but more brownish in color. They have small, 
                            sharp teeth, acute night vision, and a keen sense of smell. Also, like Orcs, they have highly developed immune systems and heal 
                            very quickly. Unlike other Orcs, Gorbloc can manipulate chaos and are known to have both mages and clerics, although it is not 
                            known how Gorbocs learn their arcane skills.
                            World Context: They appear to be less xenophobic than other bestial races, preferring to hide rather than attack if possible. 
                            Like other bestial races, Gorbocs have become increasingly active in the world for some unknown reason. Gorbocs have even recently 
                            been seen in the presence of other Orcs, which is unusual.

                        <p class="game_info_desc">
                            Gralner appear to be the cross between a humanoid and an animal. Their appearance is an odd combination of feline and lupine 
                            characteristics. Males tend more toward the lupine, while females tend more toward feline. Most have thick fatty humps located 
                            on their backs, which are capable of storing a great deal of internal moisture. Thus gralner are ideally suited for living in 
                            the harsh and arid regions of the Black Sands Desert. They average close to 7 feet in height, with no noticeable difference between 
                            males and females. However, males tend to outweigh females by more than 50%.
                            All gralner are very strong and incredibly fast and agile for their size. However, they are generally not very intelligent and 
                            completely lack the natural ability to manipulate chaos. Oddly there are always a few gralner clerics of immense power. Gralner 
                            only reproduce once in a lifetime, giving birth to a litter of 5 - 10, thus they are fewer in number than most races. Also due to 
                            this limited reproductive cycle, gralner are violently protective of their young.
                            Gralner are a vicious and violent race, with strong xenophobic tendencies. They have been known to eat the flesh of their fallen 
                            victims and often use the bones to make weapons, armor and ornamentations. Gralner have also been observed to commit cannibalism 
                            under harsh conditions and to brutally slay sick and elderly members of their tribes.
                            Gralner tribes tend to be small and mostly nomadic. They are hunter-gatherers that often follow the migrations of sand-shark herds. 
                            The tribes are usually lead by the gralner clerics, who worship a nameless god. However, due to the low number of these clerics, 
                            some tribes are lead by the largest male hunter. These tribes live in harmony for the most part, however, large battles between 
                            gralner tribes have been witnessed.
                            Historically the gralner have maintained their simple lives in the vastness of the Black Sands Desert. During the First War of 
                            Dominance, an unknown force was able to rally an immense army of gralner from scores of tribes and lay siege to the Kingdom of 
                            Bayse and even to the capital city of Tansar itself.
                            Much of what is known of the gralner has been acquired by various explorers and mages, and almost always from a great distance. 
                            Travelers should be wary of the Black Dunes altogether, but of the gralner most of all.

                            Ogres are the progeny of an orcish father and a giant mother. All known ogre births are the result of rape. The peaceful race 
                            of giants believe life to be precious and will not directly take the life of a child, even one as freakish as an ogre. Ogre 
                            children are 'given into the hands of the gods' and left upon an altar on a distant mountain. The few ogres that survive are 
                            usually found and raised by orcs. Due to these facts, there are very few ogres in the world. Ogres strongly resemble their 
                            orcish fathers, but are enormous in size. They average nearly eight feet in height. Their limbs are thick and knotted with 
                            muscle, and are easily as strong as female giants. Ogres have little or no hair, and their eyes are always completely black. 
                            Their sense of smell is unparalleled amongst the sentient races of Entia. They eat enormous amounts of food and heal faster 
                            than any other race. They are also extremely fast for their size and can quickly travel great distances. The ogre trait known 
                            to all is their brutality and ferocity. They know no fear and will seldom flee a battle. Ogres are attacked on sight, or fled 
                            from, by most other races. They have no ability to manipulate chaos and there are no known ogre clerics, though all ogres are 
                            thought to worship the ogre god, Paghk. Ogres are fairly simple to understand; they live to kill.

                            Orcs are what the dwarves call a 'strunkt' (sub-human) race. Most of the other sentient races of Entia view them as little 
                            more than vermin. They propagate very fast and seem to live only to breed, eat and fight. Orcs are of similar size to humans 
                            with broad flat faces. They have thick, course hair which also grows along the neck and upper half of their spines. Their 
                            skin is thick, rough and greyish in color. Orcs have dozens of small sharp teeth, acute night vision and a keen sense of 
                            smell. They have highly developed immune systems and heal very quickly. They speak a simple, gutteral language and most are 
                            of limited intelligence. Orcs lack the ability to manipulate chaos and there is no record of orcish clerics.
                            Orcs live in tribe-like organizations, usually located in caverns in the various mountain ranges of Balric. Orcs are a severely 
                            xenophobic race. They will attack almost any living creature they happen across if they outnumber it or are much large than it. 
                            Individually orcs are cowardly and will run from almost anything larger than them or from groups.

                            The tarr are the newest race to the face of Entia. They are believed to be an odd mixing of ogre and human, and to have come 
                            into existance through magic. They breed faster than their distant cousins the orcs, but have extremely short life spans. It 
                            is uncommon for a tarr to live beyond thirty years. Tarr are slightly larger than humans on average and are extremely strong 
                            for their size. They have a greyish tint to their skin and their teeth are usually small and jagged.
                            Tarr live exclusively in the Red Ridge Mountains, south of Gartome and north of Nera Valley. The tarr nation is made up of a 
                            loosely knit confederation of tribes. Each tribe is led by a triumvirate made up of a warrior chief, a high priest and a 
                            chaotic mage. The most powerful tribe leads the confederation. The various tribes are often at war with each other. 
                            Occassionally the tribes will cooperate enough to launch raids on western Makilor or northern Bayse.
                            The tarr worship the gods of chaos and their short lives are spent engendering as much chaos as they can. Tarr are extremely 
                            dangerous and unpredictable. Needless to say tarr are not welcome in the domains of other races.

                            The wep are from a completely different evolutionary branch than the other sentient races of Entia. They appear to be the cross 
                            between a fish and a human, but there is nothing human about them. Their bodies are anthropomorphous in limb, but have a long, 
                            thick tail, webbed fingers and toes tipped with small claws. They have two large lid-less eyes and their mouths are small but 
                            have hundreds small sharp teeth. Wep skin is covered with small bluish-green scales and they have six gill slits along the sides 
                            of their necks. Wep lack the natural ability to manipulate entropy, but are known to have powerful clerics who worship the gods 
                            of chaos.
                            Wep are amphibious, spending much of their lives in the waters of the Aonos Sea, but also capable of living on land for short
                            periods. Wep can breath water or air. They are as fast and agile as sharks in the water, but move slowly on land. They are incredibly 
                            strong in either environment. Wep will eat the flesh of opponents that fall to them in battle, no matter the race. Wep are also known 
                            to keep sharks as pets and guards.
                            Wep society is monarchical in nature, with a single family ruling all others. The Kingdom of Naran is currently at a state of 
                            war with the Wep Empire for control of Felan Isle in the Aonos Sea. Little is known as to the motives of the Wep, but they are 
                            extremely territorial. Wep are dangerous when encountered on land and deadly when encountered in water.
